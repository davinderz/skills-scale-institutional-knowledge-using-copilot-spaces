# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation. This README provides a comprehensive overview of OctoAcme's project management processes and serves as a central entry point for all process documentation.

## Overview

OctoAcme employs a customer-first, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our methodology is designed to deliver product features, services, and integrations through small, testable increments while maintaining high quality standards and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

At the heart of OctoAcme's project management framework are clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) who coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications, working alongside a Product Manager (PdM) who defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success. Developers implement features and collaborate on design and testability, while QA/Testing validates quality and acceptance criteria. This collaborative structure ensures that all stakeholders provide meaningful inputs and approvals throughout the project lifecycle.

The OctoAcme project lifecycle follows five core phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. During initiation, teams validate the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and create a high-level timeline. Planning transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria and risk mitigation strategies. Execution involves daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular demos, with progress tracked through project boards and measured against defined metrics. Release activities follow standardized deployment checklists with rollback plans and post-deployment verification. Finally, retrospectives capture learnings after each sprint, release, or milestone, converting insights into actionable improvements that drive continuous enhancement of our processes.

Communication and quality assurance are integral to the OctoAcme approach. Teams maintain a regular cadence with weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Key artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, risk registers, and retrospective notes provide transparency and enable informed decision-making. Quality is ensured through comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), security scanning in CI pipelines, and clear definitions of done. This structured yet flexible framework enables teams to deliver reliable, customer-focused solutions while continuously learning and improving.
